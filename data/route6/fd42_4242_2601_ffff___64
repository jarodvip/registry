route6:             fd42:4242:2601:ffff::/64
descr:              This is an ROA test object
max-length:         112
remarks:            
                    This object is designed to test ROA scripts
                    in a number of ways.

                    The expected output for this route should be:
                    roa fd42:4242:2601:ffff::/64 max 64 as 0;
+
                    This is not a blank line
                    + ----- +
+
                    The first test is to include a number of syntax
                    corner cases, designed to trip up parsers
+
                    The first max-length line should be clamped
                    to the maximums defined in filter6.txt
+
                    The second max-length is part of the remark
                    and should be ignored.
+
                    max-length: 48
